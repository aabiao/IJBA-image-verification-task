# IJBA-image-verification-task

This repo uses ResNets to help solve the infamous IJBA-A problem - https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Klare_Pushing_the_Frontiers_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf

Its a classic face recognition problem where after we detect faces in video frames, can we identify the person based on a limited set of examples? This repo explores the possibility of using ResNet-101 and ResNet-50 for the tasks and performs considerably well with ~70% overall accuracy.
